    What in the world is that button doing there? I offer you, dear user, the following explanation. There are many ways one could feasibly support this project. I originally built this tool to serve my purposes, and the options present reflect that. I couldn't have possibly predicted that at some point the add-on would be used upwards of 100,000 times a week. These days, much as I try to predict what will be most useful to the broadest spectrum of people, I know that there are uses that I cannot imagine. By <a href="mailto:shlomi.helfgot@yale.edu">sending me an email</a> explaining how you use the add on and what features you would like to see, you enable me to update the add on and make using it a better experience for everyone! (And the encouragement I get from knowing that behind the usage statistics are real people using this add on is also a dose of motivation in and of itself!)

    I am currently a college student with negative hours of free time a day, and it is easy to let this project languish in the dustbin of old projects - which in fact was the case for the time I spent in Yeshiva and most of my college career. When I receive positive feedback or actual investment in a certain project, I devote more of my time and my thought to it. As such, consider sending me an email at the address above or "buying me a coffee" (among other things! more to come!) at <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/shlomihelfr"><img height="27em" src="https://img.buymeacoffee.com/button-api/?text=Buy me a coffee&emoji=&slug=shlomihelfr&button_colour=ffa82e&font_colour=000000&font_family=Inter&outline_colour=000000&coffee_colour=FFDD00" /></a>. All monetary contributions - after ma'aser kesafim (obligatory tithe) is taken - will be spent, bli neder, on development tools for the betterment of this add on and seforim (which will also benefit this add on, seeing as I use the add-on and think of ways to improve it when I learn Torah.) Something feels off about even coming close to soliciting donations in general, and especially when it comes to spreading Torah (but am heartened by the <a href="https://yerushalmi.alhatorah.org/Full/Nedarim/21.3#e0n6">Yerushalmi's permissive stance on the topic</a>).
